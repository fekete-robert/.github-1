# Governance

Kube logging is a project with an open community. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project, ask for certain features and comment on design proposals made by project maintainers. This document describes how to set about contributing to the project and how design decisions take place.

## Roles And Responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

We ask our users to participate in the project and community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user contributions include (but are not limited to):

* evangelizing about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
* informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
* providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
* adding their company to the project's ADOPTERS.md file

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming contributors, as described in the next section.

### Contributors

Contributors are assigned a specific role (`logging-operator-contributors`) and added to the `#logging-operator-contributors` channel on the project Discord.

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users)
* reporting bugs
* identifying requirements
* providing graphics and web design
* assisting with project infrastructure
* writing documentation
* fixing bugs
* adding features
* speaking about the project in public forums

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker, mailing list, the Discord channel, or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the project itself via pull requests, which will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing maintainers (see next section).

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within, and commitment to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being granted read/write access to specific repositories, so that they can review/approve pull requests respectively. Such access can be granted based on the maintainers decisions.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are core developers who take part in making decisions around implementing proposed features, introducing new components, introducing breaking changes when it is necessary and defining the project's roadmap.

Maintainers have direct access to the project’s resources. This does not mean that a maintainer is free to do what they want. Their work continues to be reviewed by the community before acceptance in an official release. A maintainer is not allowed to merge their change without approval from other maintainers or contributors with approval right.

New maintainers can be nominated by existing maintainers. Once they have been nominated, there will be a vote by the maintainer team to decide whether to accept or reject the nomination.
